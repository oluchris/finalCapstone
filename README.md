# Project - Shoe Inventory System
## Description
This project involved building a program in python using object oriental programming principle, classes and object. The program allows users to search products by code, determine the product with lowest the quantity and restock it, determine the product with the hightest quantity, calculate the total value of each stock item, add stock to the inventory and view all stock in the inventory. The shoe inventory system reads and save data to a text file called inventory.txt, which has five columns with the first row having the following header values - Country, Code, Product, Cost and Quantity.

The shoe inventory system helps users (store managers) to optimise delivery time and improve organization. 

## File list
- inventory.py
- inventory.txt
