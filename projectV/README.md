# Project - Bookstore Management System
## Description
This project involved building a program in python which allows users to enter data about new books into a database, update book information, delete books from the database and search to find the availability of the books in the database. The database ebookstore contains a table called books, which contains an initial record of five books with unique IDs from 3001 to 3005. Each time a book is added the ID is incremented by one, i.e the first new book entry will have an ID 3006.

The bookstore management system helps users maintain accurate records for their book inventory.
